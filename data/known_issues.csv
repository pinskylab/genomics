Ligation L2245 blasts to a damsel fish.  It is also hard to believe that while I was separating out vials of clownfish and anemones and labeling them as such, I would mistake an anemone sample for a clownfish sample.  I think that a clownfish sample was collected but not recorded on the data sheet."

Either the fish moved or some other DNA than the one on the label went into this analysis.  We collected fish that were small enough and in the correct location to be a match for the 2016 fish, 8 are ungenotyped as of 2018."
