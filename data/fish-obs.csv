Changed fin_id and sample_id from APCL12_047 to NULL on the 8.1cm fish (fish_table_id 91).   Malin wrote 47 down twice but only collected one sample. There are not 2 tubes labeled 47.  Had to guess which of these fish represents the fin clip.  Could be either.  This was a day when Gerry was bringing fish up to Malin on a boat and things were hectic. - MRS
